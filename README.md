# hello-world

Hello Everyone,

My name is Donovan, and I am a beginning software engineer, who has his associate degree in mathematics and computer science. There is still alot I need to learn, for example becoming better at computional thinking, and understanding how everything functions. I feel like once I understand that, then I can start soaring. Furthermore, even though, computer science is confusing as of right now; I will admit that it is exciting and a field where you are always learning. Which is great. Aside from computer science, some of my hobbies consists of sports, music, movies, and writing. We should collaborate if you share the same interests, or if you would like to hang out.
